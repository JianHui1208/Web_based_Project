<h2 style="font-family: 'Seymour One';">The McDonald Brothers</h2>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Dick and Mac McDonald moved to California to seek opportunities they felt unavailable in New England. Failing in the movie business, they subsequently proved successful in operating drive-in restaurants. In 1948 they took a risk by streamlining their operations and introducing their Speedee Service System featuring 15 cent hamburgers. The restaurant’s success led the brothers to begin franchising their concept—nine becoming operating restaurants.</p>

<h1 style="font-family: 'Seymour One';">Ray Kroc</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;"> A native Chicagoan, Ray Kroc left high school after his sophomore year to join the World War One Red Cross Ambulance Corps. The war ended before his unit was sent overseas with Ray returning home to earn a living as a musician and later selling paper cups. In 1939, he became the exclusive distributor of the Multimixer (a milkshake mixing machine). He visited the McDonald brothers in 1954 which led to him becoming their franchise agent. He opened up the first restaurant for McDonald’s System, Inc., a predecessor of McDonald’s Corp. in Des Plaines, Illinois in April, 1955. McDonald’s acquired the rights to the brother’s company in 1961 for $2.7 million.</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;">Ray Kroc’s vision was that there would be 1,000 McDonald’s restaurants solely in the United States. Yet, McDonald’s continued to grow and expand into international markets beginning in 1967 opening in Canada and Puerto Rico. Today, the company has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 nations. The most recent opening in Kazakhstan in 2016.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Seymour One';">The Red And White</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">The McDonald brothers insisted that their architect design an attention catching building that would highlight their Speedee Service System. Architect Stanley Meson design of the “Red and White” did not disappoint. Feeling that the roof line was a bit too flat Dick McDonald added arches to the building.  A sign maker incorporated yellow neon into them creating the “Golden Arches”. The oldest McDonald’s Red and White (opened in 1953) still operating today is in Downey, California.</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;">McDonald’s introduced the new Mansard Roof Design in 1969 in Matteson, Illinois. Initially, many franchisees remodeled their existing Red and White buildings to reflect the new design. McDonaldland Parks (Play Places) and the Drive-Thru were added to the restaurant during the 1970s. The Mansard’s exterior underwent several changes during the intervening years.</p></td>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Customers visit our restaurants every day. Here you will find some stories about everyday items found in our restaurants. Did you ever wonder if there are stories about the condiment cup? Pickles?</p> 

<h2 style="font-family: 'Seymour One';">The Story Behind the Little White Cup: AKA The Dunk Cup</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">McDonalds World Famous Fries and ketchup—what a combination! When Ray Kroc opened his first McDonald’s restaurant in 1955, our fries were meant to be eaten alone, sans ketchup. The tomato based condiment was reserved solely for hamburgers and cheeseburgers.

Yet, despite the practice McDonald’s customers frequently asked for ketchup for their fries. One even wrote the company inquiring as to the reason for this practice. The response he received included “…it is the policy of McDonald’s that catsup not be served with French fries”. (I know its ketchup!) As McDonald’s restaurants expanded across the U.S. so did requests for ketchup with fries.

Southern California McDonald’s franchisees Don and Enid Dunkleman heeded their customers’ requests by creating “The Dunk Cup”. Their inspiration consisted of a modified small drink cup complete with a plastic drink lid. Each Dunk Cup containing ketchup was prepared in the morning and was placed in the refrigerator until a customer requested ketchup. Initially the Dunk Cup cost three cents or a nickel but shortly afterwards they were provided complimentary. To accommodate carry out orders ketchup packets were introduced in 1968. During the intervening years, the ubiquitous little white serving cup became a fixture in the restaurant for customers dining in.</p>
